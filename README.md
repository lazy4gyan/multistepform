- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed

## My process
I started this challenge by following these steps:
- Analyzing the design for similarities such as input fields, labels, buttons, etc.
- Creating a layout component to achieve the desired layout.
- Creating reusable components such as input fields, labels, buttons, forms, cards, and checkboxes.
- Using the Context API for state management and React Hook Form for form control and validation.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS module and custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - React library
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I have learned a react-hook-form which is a react library, for form validation in React applications.
